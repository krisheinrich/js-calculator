# js-calculator

Multi-featured calculator built with vanilla JS/HTML/CSS that supports nested grouping with parentheses, the exponent '^' operation, and answer recall.

The calculator logic follows the rules of the arithmetic order of operations when evaluating expressions with parentheses, so the innermost parentetical groupings are evaluated first, then their results are used to recursively simplify the entire input expression.
